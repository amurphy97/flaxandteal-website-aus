# Arches for Cultural Heritage Institutions

We are currently in the process of delivering a long-term digital transformation project
for Northern Irish public sector, migrating all of their current and historic heritage-
based data to a customised Arches HER (Historic Environment Record) instance. They
required a secure and accessible database capable of holding more than 200,000 records
safely and without data loss.

This has involved site visits, workshops and detailed data modelling exercises, and has
been supported on the technology side by Kubernetes, Python-in-the-cloud, Ray data
workflows and deployed to GKE. This is due to go live in mid-2024, and so far project
deliverables have been met on time and successfully.
