# About Us
## Where it all began
Our name, _Flax & Teal_ has an interesting back story, which broadly summarises our company's philosophy. Our Director, Phil Weir, spent over 3 years completing his PhD in New Zealand, a whopping 11,468 miles from his roots in Northern Ireland. Turns out, Northern Ireland and New Zealand have more in common than one would think.
_Flax_ is a flowering plant which grows natively both in NI and NZ, whereas _Teal_ is a species of duck (no, really), which is also natively found in both regions. Our name broadly summarises our viewpoint as a company; looking both at home and away.
Although we are a small company, our team currently spans across 7 countries, and is something we are passionate about growing. While we are locally based in Belfast, it doesn't stop us from acquiring talent around the world. This focus also applies to our customer base, we don't believe in being confined to just one market.
