### [Coding](#rampd-software-development) | Cloud Architecture | Consulting

Flax & Teal is a consultancy focused on openly-licensed technologies, serving public and private sector through web-based products and services in computational engineering, geospatial analysis and data science (machine learning and AI). 

_Flax & Teal builds tools for private and public sector including publicly-shared, reusable parts - these are often web platforms providing behind-the-scenes analysis of open data, geography and physics._

F&T is also part of a multidisciplinary consortium of small businesses in Northern Ireland: [Avata Industries](https://avata.industries),
which together build openly-licensed products.

With our mix of industry and academic computing experience, we are well-placed to support complex R&amp;D subcontracts, including general and specialist development on **Horizon 2020** and **InnovateUK** projects. We are also certified [Arches](https://www.archesproject.org/) providers, an open source cultural heritage management platform.

## R&amp;D Software Development

### Web | Data | Engineering | Science

<sub>Prototype builds starting from £20,000 (ex VAT)<br/>Solely or as a collaborative lead, F&amp;T regularly runs five and six figure new-tech, multidisciplinary projects.</sub>

Flax &amp; Teal has coordinated and driven a number of complex client projects across technologies since 2013, and supported others. We build intricate applications ourselves or, for large projects, draw together a multidisciplinary team from across the Avata Industries group.

Flax &amp; Teal has in-house experience supporting projects funded under EU and InnovateUK R&amp;D frameworks; coordination of work packages involving training, software development, data analysis, machine learning, focus groups and design.

We have experience in health, enterprise, numerical simulation, engineering, journalism, public and education sectors, amongst others.

We work with organizations in the UK, Ireland, continental EU and Australasia.

_Sustainably open: we contribute non-commercially-sensitive code back to projects we build on top of, where relevant, and are keen to work with clients open to this principle._
