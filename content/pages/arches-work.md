# About Arches

Arches is an open source data management platform which makes it possible for meaningful organisational change. Jointly funded by the World Monument Fund and the Getty Conservation Institute, it has evolved into a powerful asset management and GIS tool. We have conducted Arches workshops with the Arches team to build a roadmap for integrating the Arches software with modern DevOps flows, and are the leading team in doing so. 

We have been invited to produce detailed demonstrations of Arches for Heritage NZ, New
Zealand’s national heritage organisation, and have a demonstration instance of Arches using a
range of NI cultural heritage building and shipwreck data, as well as an early-stage
project with Antartic researchers on historic polar exploration. We have run community
events combining Arches platforms and Virtual Reality spaces, to push Arches’ technical
capabilities.
