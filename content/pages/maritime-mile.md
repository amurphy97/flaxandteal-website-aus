# Explore Belfast’s Maritime Mile History Like Never Before

### Welcome to the Virtual Heritage Experience

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction=column;">
Dive into the past with an innovative way to explore historical images, videos, audio clips, and captivating stories from heritage archives. Our project uses 3D/VR technology to bring history to life right at your fingertips.

How it Works:

- Scan & Discover: Find one of our 6 strategically placed QR code plaques, scan it with your smartphone, and step into a snapshot of history. 
- Step Into the Past: There are 6 Rooms, each with a unique QR code located along the Maritime Mile. Navigate through these 6 uniquely themed 3D/VR rooms created and hosted in Mozilla Hub. Whether you’re a history buff or a curious explorer, each room offers a distinct journey through time:
  - People & Community: Experience the life and evolution of local communities.
  - Industry: Explore Belfast’s industrial past.
  - Shipbuilding: Witness the craftsmanship and legacy of historical shipyards.
  - Art & Culture: A snapshot of the city’s artistic and cultural heritage.
  - Archives: Documents and photographs, each with a story to tell.
  - Titanic: Relive the stories of the legendary Titanic.
