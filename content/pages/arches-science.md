# Arches for Science 

We have deployed, and are currently hosting, Arches as a data repository for a large-
scale international cross-disciplinary research project on urban policy (Tomorrow's Cities). 

This involved interviewing a range of researchers, from social scientists to
geologists, to establish a common base of requirements, and ensuring UKRI (UK Research
and Innovation) compliant documentation and data management. 

Tomorrowâ€™s Cities is being conducted with a range of institutions in Scotland, Nepal, Kenya and Turkey and,
indirectly, governmental stakeholders to inform risk management for urban disaster
planning globally.
