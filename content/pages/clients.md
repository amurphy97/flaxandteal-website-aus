# Clients & Case Studies
We've been fortunate enough to work with a wide range of clients across various sectors, ensuring project completion and client satisfaction along the way. 

### [Arches](/pages/arches-work)
A selection of our commercial Arches work, an open source data management solution. We are recognized Arches providers, an open source cultural heritage management
platform, with GIS capability and suitable for movable and immovable heritage assets. We have used NI cultural heritage data in an education setting, to educate school children on the risks of imagined natural hazards to, for example, Areas of Significant Archaeological Interest and sites on the Industrial Heritage Record.

### [Big Motive](https://www.bigmotive.com/) 

“We, at Big Motive, have worked with Flax & Teal on multiple technical projects and have benefited significantly from their ability to provide agile planning and delivery of technical work. From the early stages of the projects, Flax and Teal worked extremely well with all stakeholders, including the design and client teams to fully understand the project and co-create requirements. <br>

Always ensuring realistic, achievable and technical expectations. They are an extremely responsive team and always willing to help during challenging parts of the project, including unforeseen requirement changes and bugs/development issues. Phil's Kubernetes, data and architecture expertise has allowed us to deliver a much needed health product to time and to spec within a supportive and collaborative environment. Phil's team allowed us to scale our acceptability and feasibility trial for this product by effectively scaling for a larger base of second phase users, with responsive support. We look forward to our continued work with Flax & Teal, particularly as we bring the health product mentioned through to a larger trial.” </br>

### [Boards123](http://boards123.com) 

Boards123 innovates Board Performance. We do this with our software, services and training products. 
We work with Flax and Teal as our technology partner, as they are experts in transforming complex data and management systems into easy-to-use, highly accessible and intelligent software solutions. <br>

Flax and Teal are also dedicated to sustainable software development, which is essential as part of our shared Net Zero 2050 goals. Flax and Teal will add-value to your project from the initial user discovery phase through to testing and deployment. The team is highly skilled in product development, software development, hosting and integrating open source data into software solutions. Boards123 benefited greatly from Flax and Teal's commitment to scoping and requirements early and often. We worked in partnership to ensure the project was feasible and achievable within the available budget and to a market-ready quality standard. This led to a positive software development experience where we all felt engaged, informed and on-track. Boards123 highly recommends Flax and Teal. </br>

### Deloitte
Flax & Teal partnered with Deloitte to build an enterprise-level data gathering Human Resources platform. The digital transformation project changed the way resources are managed by quantifying time allocated to various departments. This project involved an iterative Agile, full stack build and development of cloud infrastructure. The team deployed Kubernetes to ensure flexibility and resilience of service. 

### OpenDataNI
