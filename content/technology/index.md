Open source is pervasive throughout IT, especially within cloud, data and web. While all sectors are now indirectly dependent on open source projects, uptake has been
far slower outside IT, at least outside major international innovation hubs.

We believe this is due to a traditional view of IP and technology business value, that is being superseded, driven by the realisable net business benefit to procuring open
source solutions in all sectors, and proven case studies in AI, cloud, automation, IoT and automotive.
