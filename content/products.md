## Our Raging PlanetÂ (ORP)

### Geospatial Risk Simulation  

**How would the business supply chain crises in UK, flash-floods in South America, the earthquakes of New Zealand, the wildfires of California or volcanic activity of the Pacific Rim unfold?**

This project provides an adaptable platform for businesses, government and risk modellers to improve resilience and assess the implications of extreme events on their own services and surroundings.

It is a web application, with custom tools and interactive maps that allow users to apply basic simulations to their area in the region, using an extensible range of data to estimate the impact on familiar local landmarks.
