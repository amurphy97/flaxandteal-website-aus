**How would the business supply chain crises in UK, flash-floods in South America, the earthquakes of New Zealand, the wildfires of California or volcanic activity of the Pacific Rim unfold?**

This project provides an adaptable platform for businesses, government and risk modellers to improve resilience and assess the implications of extreme events on their own services and surroundings.

It is a web application, with custom tools and interactive maps that allow users to apply basic simulations to their area in the region, using an extensible range of data to estimate the impact on familiar local landmarks.

**Flax & Teal is the lead of the [Lintol](https://lintol.io/) project, driving technical creation, tendering, administrative needs, back-end development, infrastructure and data science.**

Lintol is an open data validating tool, much like a grammar checker for open data (data which everyone can access, use or share).

The Lintol project works with existing open data platforms, linking into existing workflows, and providing custom reports flagging potential issues with data prior to release.

**Flax & Teal is the lead consortium member for [The Data Times](https://thedatatimes.com/) in a joint [Avata Industries](https://avata.industries/) / [VIEWdigital](https://flaxandteal.co.uk/pages/projects/viewdigital.org) project to build a data discovery tool for community journalists to help lower the bar to well-grounded data and accountability journalism.** 

We have successfully delivered remote workshops to higher education institutions surrounding open data and using The Data Times for data-driven journalism.

The Data Times will be a simple, clean tool for journalists to started with data-driven journalism, discovering data focused to their area, guiding them through the first steps of a visually-engaging, data-grounded argument.
This project is in prototype phase, and we are keen to engage with any potential stakeholders. Please do contact us if you have an interest in this or any of the other products above.
